In this project, we will do some streaming data in twitter, we will take tweet that contains open.spotify.com. And we crawl information from that tweets using 'expanded_url' tags. After that we will classified the data that contains "album", "song", "playlist" and "website".
I'm using Kibana for view the data, and store classification data into hdfs and hive(data warehouse) to make a small data mart.



this is the final results and power point
